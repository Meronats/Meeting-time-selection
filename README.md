# Meeting-time-selection
Meeting time selector algorithm
The provided Java code allows an organizer to collect availability information from team members for a common meeting. It begins by gathering the names and 1-hour time slot availability of each team member. 
The code then determines the common meeting time slot by finding the intersection of available time slots among team members. 
If there's a match, it prints the common meeting time slots in HH:MM-HH:MM format. 
The code also includes error handling to ensure that team members input their availability correctly.
